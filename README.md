# automation
🚀 Successfully built my first Python-based automation tool that connects Windows with Linux (RHEL 9.6) using SSH for remote web server management!  ✨ Commands like date, cal, ls, and ifconfig now run from one OS to another — all in real time.  Grateful to Vimal Daga Sir for his constant guidance and motivation. 🙏
